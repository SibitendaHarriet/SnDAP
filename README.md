# SnDAP
**Analyzing social network data about development social concerns**

---

## Overview
**SnDAP** (Social Network Data Analysis and Prediction) is a web-based application for analyzing and predicting themes, topics, and sentiment trends related to development and social concerns. It enables users to explore pre-trained datasets, visualize insights, and upload their own data for predictions.

---

## Features
### üîç **Data Analysis**
- **Topics Analysis**: Generate visualizations like Word Clouds, Histograms, and Bar Charts to explore key topics.
- **Themes Analysis**: Classify content into themes like poverty, education, and health. Visualize data distributions using Word Clouds and Bar Charts.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment trends across datasets.

### üìà **Temporal Analysis**
- **Analyze Themes and Topics Over Time**:
  - Visualize the evolution of themes and topics over **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**, or **yearly** timeframes.
  - Use dynamic filtering options to refine results by frequency ranges and sentiment categories.
  - Gain insights into trends through time-series plots, highlighting the sentiment-specific progression of key topics or themes.
  
- **Forecast Trends with Prophet**:
  - Use forecasting models to predict future trends for selected themes or topics.
  - Visualize forecasts alongside historical data, including confidence intervals, for deeper insights.

### üåê **Social Network Analysis**
- **Explore Entity Relationships**:
  - Analyze relationships among entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in social network datasets.
  - Filter datasets based on specific entity categories.

- **Build Social Networks**:
  - Create interactive graph visualizations to depict connections between **Topics**, **Themes**, and **Sentiments**.
  - Nodes and edges are generated dynamically from relationships in the data.

- **Node Embedding and Graph Analysis**:
  - Utilize advanced techniques like **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** and **PCA** for embedding nodes into low-dimensional space.
  - Visualize nodes based on **Community**, **Influence**, or **Link** attributes, with metrics like:
    - **Modularity**, **Clustering Coefficients**, and **Degree** (for community analysis).
    - **Closeness Centrality**, **Betweenness Centrality**, and **Eigenvector Centrality** (for influence analysis).
    - **PageRank** and **Network Density** (for link analysis).

- **Dynamic Graph Filtering**:
  - Filter graphs by selecting a percentage of nodes to visualize, prioritizing high-weighted entities for clarity.
  - Generate exportable graph screenshots for reporting.

### üìä **Custom Predictions**
- Upload your dataset in CSV format for prediction and analysis of themes, topics, and sentiment trends.
- Download analyzed results or visualizations for future use.

### üé® **Interactive Visualizations**
- Create and explore dynamic visualizations powered by **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
